Welcome to Project Exosphir!

## Setup ##

1. Get the repository.
2. Open in Unity.

Take your time to learn the code.  DO NOT EDIT THE CODE IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT IT DOES.  You can use the Debug class to figure out what stuff does.  Once you understand the existing code, go ahead and add on.

## Notes on Repository Management ##

Do not commit meta data, the Library folder created by Unity, or any non-modified Standard Assets.  It wastes valuable space.
